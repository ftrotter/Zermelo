### Step 2: Implement Dual SQL Queries for MySQL and PostgreSQL

Once the test suite is in place, I will begin implementing PostgreSQL support by providing alternative queries.

- __Objective:__ To modify the system so that it can execute the correct SQL dialect based on the currently configured database connection, without changing the core logic of the reports.

- __Process:__

  1. __Detect the database driver:__ In every location where SQL is generated (primarily the `GetSQL()` method in report classes and the generator classes like `ReportGenerator` and `GraphGenerator`), I will add logic to check the current database driver (e.g., using Laravel's `DB::connection()->getDriverName()`).

  2. __Provide parallel SQL statements:__ Based on the driver detected (`mysql` or `pgsql`), the method will return the appropriate SQL string.

  3. __Translate MySQL-specific code:__ I will translate all MySQL-specific functions and syntax to their PostgreSQL equivalents. This includes:

     - __Functions:__ `IF()` becomes `CASE`, `CONCAT()` becomes the `||` operator or the standard `CONCAT()` function, `FROM_UNIXTIME()` becomes `to_timestamp()`, etc.
     - __Syntax:__ Backticks for identifiers will be replaced with standard double quotes, and `COLLATE` clauses will be removed or adapted for PostgreSQL.

  4. __Run tests:__ After modifying each report or generator, I will run the test suite against both a MySQL and a PostgreSQL database to verify that the output remains correct for both platforms.
